# Distributed_training

The aim of this project is to implement distributed training in an HPC environment and compare
two approaches:

- An out-of-the-box distributed training framework: PyTorch Lightning
- A customized pipeline defined by MPI4PY

# Project Structure

- `mpi4py/`: contains the code for the MPI4PY approach
- `pytorch_lighting/`: contains the code for the PyTorch Lightning approach

# Detailed Instructions

Please refer to the README.md files in each directory for more detailed instructions on how to run the code.

- [mpi4py/README.md](mpi4py/README.md)
- [pytorch_lighting/README.md](pytorch_lighting/README.md)
